# Contour-ASL-Gesture-Recognition
This is my prototype of a real time contour comparison system that receives users’ gestural input via web camera and compares it to my own set of previously compiled images to determine peak similarities. These simularities determine the actual gesture with a negligible marginof error when used in the correct environment. I relied heavily on the OpenCV library in Python, which deals mainly with computer vision, to define a method of comparison to implement, and to finally optimize this build in its entirety. Relies on python 2.7 and CC2 imports,along with numpy.
