# Contour-ASL-Gesture-Recognition

This is my prototype of a real time contour comparison system that receives usersâ€™ gestural input via web camera and compares it to my own set of previously compiled images to determine peak similarities. These simularities determine the actual gesture with a negligible margin of error when used in the correct environment. I relied heavily on the OpenCV library in Python, which deals mainly with computer vision, to define a method of comparison to implement, and to finally optimize this build in its entirety. Relies on python 2.7 and CC2 imports, along with numpy.
